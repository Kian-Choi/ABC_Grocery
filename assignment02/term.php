    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>

    <h3>OUR RIGHT TO CHANGE TERMS & CONDITIONS OF EACH PROGRAM</h3>

    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify all or a portion of the terms & conditions of one or more of the Programs at any time without further notice and without incurring any liability or obligation. If we do this, we will post such changes to the terms & conditions on the Application by indicating at the top of this page the date the terms & conditions were last revised. Your continued access to and/or use of the Application after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, the terms & conditions as revised. It is your sole responsibility to regularly check the Application to determine if there have been any changes to the terms & conditions and to review such changes.</p>

If you do not have an Account, you can register for one through the Application. When registering for an Account, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself as requested and to promptly update such information as necessary to ensure that it is kept accurate and complete.</p>

    <h3>VERIFICATION</h3>

    <p>All orders are subject to verification at any time and for any reason. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require proof of identity: (i) for the purposes of verifying the legitimacy of any order or other information; (ii) for compliance with all applicable laws; or (iii) for any other reason we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, for the purposes of facilitating or fulfilling an order in accordance with the applicable Program terms & conditions.</p>

Further, we reserve the right to verify the validity of all orders and cancel any order if we find evidence of fraud, tampering and/or any other violation of these terms & conditions. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing address. Not all products available in-store may be available online.</p>
    <!-- COMMUNICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS REGARDING ORDER STATUS

        We reserve the right to contact you via your preferred method of communication selected at the time you set up your Account for matters related to your order such as availability of product or to let you know the order is available for pick-up or has been shipped.
