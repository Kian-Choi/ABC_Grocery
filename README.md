# ABC_Grocery

ABC grocery is an open-ended school assignment created by me and my classmate, Bill Chow. The project is an online grocery store that features functionalities such as user sign up, sign in, adding items to cart, checking out, and more.

To enhance the user experience, we used CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive web page that adapts to different device sizes.

JavaScript was implemented to validate user input and perform other functions, ensuring a seamless user experience.

PHP was utilized for connecting to a MySQL database and managing user sessions, as well as for the reuse of HTML code elements such as headers and footers.
